// A central server will contain the codebase for all the engineers

// Problem is if they are not close to a place to connect to the server, they can not work on the code.
// If something bad happens and the server is damaged, the code is lost and nobody can work on it.

Do not have to be physically present. Can connect remotely.

// No fear of losing the code.
// Copy of the code stays in their system.
